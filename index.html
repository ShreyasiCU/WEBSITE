                    <p class="lead">The term "Exodus" became popular during the COVID-19 pandemic which means there is an alleged mass emigration of residents from California to other U.S. states and countries. 
                        The cause and existence of this migration has been extensively debated.

                    <p class="lead2"><cite> "California’s population has shrunk for the second year in a row, according to newly released figures.

                        Officials blamed the decrease on declining birth rates, higher deaths from the pandemic and fewer people moving into the state from elsewhere in the US. California lost 117,552 people in 2021, putting its population at 39,185,605". quoted by California department of finance.</cite></p>

                <h2> <span class="m-text">Current</span> Scenario </h2>
                <p>Lower levels of international migration, declining birth rates, and increases in deaths all play a role. But the primary driver of the state’s population loss over the past couple years has been the result of California residents moving to other states. It is a remarkable turnaround for California—long the epicenter of population growth in the United States. Even so, it is a continuation of a decades-long slow down.
Since 2010, about 7.5 million people moved from California to other states, while only 5.8 million people moved to California from other parts of the country. According to Department of Finance estimates, the state has lost residents to other states every year since 2001.
<br>
<br>
Fact is that California has been losing lower- and middle-income residents to other states for some time while continuing to gain higher-income adults. In the past five years the flow of middle-income residents out of the state has accelerated and net gains among higher income adults have ceased.</p>
